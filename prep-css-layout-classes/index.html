        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a golden idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival
        archaeologist Ren√© Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting seaplane. After returning to the
        United States, Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis, Egypt,
        and one of their telegrams mentions Jones' old mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis seek the Ark of the
        Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark
        first.</p>
